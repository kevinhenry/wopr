Make Me A Video Game!

I the funny and furry Bob have caught Jack's huge sister and plan to steal her fast wheels!

What are a bear and backpacking mouse to do? Before you can help Kayla, you'll have to collect the nice cars and fast skateboards that open up the 11 worlds connected to A Mike's Lair. There are 7 knives and 3 balls in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
